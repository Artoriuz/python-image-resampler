# python-image-resampler
Image resampling implemented in Python following the algorithm from Imageworsener described here: https://entropymine.com/imageworsener/resample/.

You need OpenCV to do image IO and Numpy for the actual calculations. The code is also using Numba for performance reasons.

This only exists so I can experiment with random filters.
